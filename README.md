# Event Listing Wordpress Plugin


## Code Challenge:

Create a simple event listing

A new custom post type for Events
The custom post type needs to have a few custom fields:

- event date (date picker)

- event location

- URL for the event

We need an archive page which will list all events, ordered by event date. Each event should have a title, location (you can add a Google map integration), event date, a link to the external source/site.
We need to have a simple "Add to Google Calendar" button, which will add the event to your Google calendar.

We are using Git, so creating a GitHub repository with the source code where you'll upload the task and share it with us.

The project should follow the latest WordPress Coding standards, you can review them here https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/

As a final note, make sure you'll use custom code. We do use 3rd party plugins, but a bit part of our work is writing custom logic from scratch, so we have to see your coding skills here.
